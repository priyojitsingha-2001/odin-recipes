    <h2>Mutton Kosha recipe</h2>
    <p>To make authentic Bengali Mutton Kosha, start by marinating mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt for at least 2 hours. Heat mustard oil in a pan until it smokes, then temper with whole garam masala (bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom). Add sliced onions and fry until golden brown. Stir in ginger-garlic paste, tomatoes, and ground spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala. Cook until the oil separates. Add the marinated mutton and sauté on medium heat until it is well-coated and releases its juices. Cover and slow-cook until tender, occasionally adding water for a rich, thick gravy. Garnish with fresh coriander and serve hot with steamed rice or parathas.</p>

    <h2>Here are the steps to make Mutton Kosha:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Mutton: Mix mutton with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, and salt. Let it marinate for at least 2 hours (overnight for better flavor).</li>
        <li>Heat Mustard Oil: In a heavy-bottomed pan or kadhai, heat mustard oil until it smokes lightly. This removes its raw aroma.</li>
        <li>Temper the Oil: Add whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom) to the hot oil and sauté for a few seconds until aromatic.</li>
        <li>Fry Onions: Add sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Cook the Masala: Stir in ginger-garlic paste and cook until the raw smell disappears. Add chopped tomatoes, cumin powder, coriander powder, and garam masala. Cook the mixture until the oil separates.</li>
        <li>Sauté the Mutton: Add the marinated mutton to the pan and sauté on medium heat. Stir frequently until the mutton is well-coated in the masala and starts releasing its juices.</li>
        <li>Slow Cook: Lower the heat, cover the pan, and let the mutton cook slowly. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Add water in small amounts if needed, for a thick, rich gravy.</li>
        <li>Final Touch: Once the mutton is tender and the gravy is thick, garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve Hot: Enjoy Mutton Kosha with steamed rice, basmati pulao, or flaky parathas!</li>
